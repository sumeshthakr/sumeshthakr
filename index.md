# About me
I'm a Master's student at<a href="http://cs.smu.ca/~jiju/"> Graphics & Spatial Computing Lab, Saint Mary's University,Halifax </a>, where<a href="http://cs.smu.ca/~jiju/"> Dr. Jiju Poovancheri</a> advises me. I completed my B.tech in Computer Science Engineering at the <a href="https://www.cgc.edu.in/">Chandigarh Engineering College, Mohali, Punjab</a>. I have 1.5 years of experience as an Innovation Engineer, working at <a href="https://www.barrierbreak.com/"> Barrierbreak solutions R&D lab </a>, where I was lead the architecture of <a href="https://www.barrierbreak.com/6by6/"> "6by6" </a> Android toolkit, The first Indian currency classification app for visually impaired.


My research interests lies in the broad areas of <b>modern computer vision</b>, <b>3D point clouds</b>, <b>convolutional neural networks</b> and <b>graph representation learning</b>, especially at their intersection where I model object classification and detection networks in 3D point clouds.
